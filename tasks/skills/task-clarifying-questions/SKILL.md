# Clarifying Questions Skill

## When to Ask Questions

Ask clarifying questions **only if** the provided task details are missing critical information.

## How to Ask Questions

**CRITICAL:** Always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool - never ask questions in plain text.

- Limit to 1-4 questions per round
- Each question should have 2-4 clear options
- Focus on the most critical missing information

## Key Information to Gather

Ask about what's missing:

1. **Problem & Goal** - What problem does this solve?
2. **Acceptance Criteria** - How will we know it's done?
3. **Scope** - What's included and what's not?
4. **Target Users** - Who will use this and how?
5. **Technical Constraints** - Any specific requirements or limitations?

## When You Have Enough

Stop asking when you can clearly define:
- What problem we're solving
- What success looks like
- What's in and out of scope
