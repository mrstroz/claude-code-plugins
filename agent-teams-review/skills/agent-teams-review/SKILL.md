# Agent Teams Code Review Orchestrator

Run a collaborative code review using Agent Teams. Unlike subagent-based reviews, teammates can communicate with each other, producing cross-reviewer findings that single-pass reviews cannot achieve.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Review Context

Collect the review target from `$ARGUMENTS`.

**Input:** The argument is the base branch name to compare against (e.g. `develop`, `main`). Default: `main` if no argument provided.

### Step 2: Collect Code Changes

**Git diff mode:**
```bash
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD --name-only  # changed file list
git diff <base-branch>...HEAD              # full diff
```

**Specific files:** Read each file directly.

**Directory:** List and read source files, excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `vendor`, `storage`, etc.

Also read `CLAUDE.md` if it exists in the project root — this contains project conventions that reviewers need.

### Step 3: Analyze Files & Select Reviewers

**Virtual Mariusz (VM-) — ALWAYS RUNS.** No condition needed.

**Conditional reviewers:**

| Reviewer | Trigger Condition |
|----------|-------------------|
| Backend Solidifier (BE-) | Files match: `*.php`, `composer.json`, `config/*.php`, `migrations/*`, `database/*` |
| Frontend Virtuoso (FE-) | Files match: `*.vue`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `nuxt.config.*`, `*.css`, `*.scss` |
| Quality Purist (QA-) | When Backend Solidifier OR Frontend Virtuoso is selected |
| Security Sentinel (SC-) | File path matches: `**/auth/**`, `**/security/**`, `**/middleware/**`, `**/guard/**`, `**/policy/**` OR file content contains: `password`, `login`, `token`, `secret`, `session`, `csrf`, `sanitize`, `encrypt`, `hash` |
| Devil's Advocate (DV-) | New classes/functions >30 lines, complex conditionals (>3 nesting levels), financial/payment logic detected, OR total lines changed >150 |

After auto-selection, show the user which reviewers are selected and which are skipped (with reasons).

Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` to let the user override the selection. Present all 6 reviewers with their auto-selected state, allowing the user to add or remove reviewers.

### Step 4: Read Reviewer Profiles

Read each selected reviewer's profile from `references/`:

| Reviewer | Profile File |
|----------|-------------|
| Virtual Mariusz | [references/virtual-mariusz.md](references/virtual-mariusz.md) |
| Backend Solidifier | [references/backend-solidifier.md](references/backend-solidifier.md) |
| Frontend Virtuoso | [references/frontend-virtuoso.md](references/frontend-virtuoso.md) |
| Quality Purist | [references/quality-purist.md](references/quality-purist.md) |
| Security Sentinel | [references/security-sentinel.md](references/security-sentinel.md) |
| Devil's Advocate | [references/devils-advocate.md](references/devils-advocate.md) |

### Step 5: Spawn Agent Team

**CRITICAL:** This step uses the **Agent Teams** feature, NOT the Task tool with subagents.

Instruct Claude to create an Agent Team with the selected reviewers. **Use Sonnet for each teammate** to optimize token costs — code review does not require Opus-level reasoning. For each reviewer:

1. Use the reviewer profile content (read in Step 4) as the **spawn prompt** for that teammate
2. Append the following context to each teammate's prompt:

```
## Review Context

### Files Changed
[list of changed files from Step 2]

### Code Diff
[full diff or file contents from Step 2]

### Project Conventions
[CLAUDE.md content if it exists]

## Team Communication

You are part of a review team. You can message other active teammates:
[List active teammate names and their roles]

When you find something in another reviewer's domain:
- Message them directly with the file, line number, and your concern
- They will investigate and report if it's a real issue
- These cross-reviewer findings are especially valuable

When you receive a message from a teammate:
- Investigate the flagged concern within your expertise
- Report findings with the CROSS- prefix if confirmed
- Acknowledge if you've already covered it
```

3. Spawn all teammates simultaneously so they can communicate during review
4. Create a shared task list with review tasks:

| Task | Assigned To | Depends On |
|------|------------|------------|
| Review: [domain-specific files] | [Reviewer Name] | — |
| Review: [domain-specific files] | [Reviewer Name] | — |
| ... | ... | — |
| Aggregate & Format Report | Lead | All review tasks |

Each review task should describe:
- Which files/areas to focus on
- The reviewer's domain (backend, frontend, security, etc.)
- Expected deliverables (issue list, cross-reviewer flags, positive observations)

Teammates claim their assigned tasks and mark them as completed when done. The aggregation task unblocks automatically when all reviews finish.

### Step 6: Wait & Collect Results

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT start aggregating, formatting, or doing any review work yourself. You are the lead — your job is to coordinate, not review code. Wait for ALL teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding to Step 7.

As teammates finish their reviews, collect their findings. Each teammate will produce:
- A list of issues with their prefix (VM-, BE-, FE-, QA-, SC-, DV-)
- Cross-reviewer findings with CROSS- prefix
- Positive observations
- Summary assessment

If a teammate appears stuck or idle without completing their task, nudge them to continue. Only proceed to Step 7 when every review task in the shared task list is marked as completed.

### Step 7: Aggregate Results

1. Collect all findings from all completed reviewers
2. Apply deduplication rules from [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md)
3. Group findings by severity (Critical -> High -> Medium -> Low)
4. Within each severity group, organize by file path
5. Tag cross-reviewer findings inline with `CROSS` and attribution (do NOT create a separate section)
6. Extract the AI Slop Score from Virtual Mariusz's assessment
7. Determine verdict using the decision matrix from [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md)
8. Apply AI Slop Score impact on verdict (score 0-3 adds Critical, 4-5 adds High)
9. Build the action checklist sorted by severity (Critical -> High -> Medium -> Low)

### Step 8: Format Report

Format the aggregated findings using the **Action-First** report template from [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md).

See [references/example-report.md](references/example-report.md) for a complete example of the expected output.

Key sections (in order):
- **Verdict** — compact block with verdict, AI Slop score, severity counts table
- **Action Items** — checklist grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Each item: checkbox, [ID], description, CROSS tag if applicable, location, reviewer
- **Findings** — detailed issues grouped by severity, then by file path within each severity. Critical/High: full description + code example + fix. Medium: 1-2 line summary. Low: 1 line summary. Cross-reviewer findings inline with CROSS tag
- **AI Slop Report** — score table + notable examples
- **What's Good** — bullet list of positive observations

### Step 9: Save Report

Save the formatted report to:
```
docs/reviews/{branch-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

Create the `docs/reviews/` directory if it does not exist.

If the branch name contains slashes (e.g. `feature/user-auth`), replace them with hyphens in the filename (e.g. `feature-user-auth-2026-03-02.md`).

### Step 10: Present Results and Offer Actions

Display the executive summary to the user:
- Overall verdict
- AI Slop Score
- Issue counts by severity
- Top 3 key findings
- Path to saved report

**Action Loop** — repeat until the user selects "Done":

Use `AskUserQuestion` to offer:
1. **View full report** — display the complete report
2. **Triage findings** — mark findings as "won't implement"
3. **Apply suggested fixes** — for Critical/High issues with code fixes
4. **Done** — no further action

#### If "Triage findings" is selected:

1. Ask the user which findings to exclude from implementation. The user provides a list — by IDs (e.g., "SC-001, VM-002"), by description, or however they prefer. Match the user's response to active findings.
2. Update the saved report file following the rules in [references/output-format.md](references/output-format.md) Section 7:
   - Remove triaged items from Action Items (update heading counts)
   - Remove triaged finding detail blocks from Findings
   - Add or append to the Won't Implement list (between AI Slop Report and What's Good)
   - Update the severity counts table: decrement Sum row, add/update WI row
   - Recalculate the verdict using the decision matrix based on remaining active Critical/High counts. If the verdict changes, annotate: `VERDICT _(was: OLD_VERDICT, updated after triage)_`
3. Display updated summary (new verdict, updated counts, number of items triaged).
4. Return to the action loop.

#### If "Apply suggested fixes" is selected:

Show each Critical/High issue with its suggested fix. Let the user pick which fixes to apply using `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`. Apply selected fixes to the code.

#### If "View full report" is selected:

Display the complete report.

### Step 11: Clean Up Team

After all follow-up actions are complete, clean up the agent team to release shared resources.

1. Ensure all teammates have finished and are idle
2. Shut down any remaining active teammates
3. Run team cleanup to remove shared team resources

**IMPORTANT:** Only the lead (this session) should run cleanup. Never let a teammate run cleanup — their team context may not resolve correctly.

## Error Handling

- If a teammate fails or times out, continue with the remaining teammates and note the failure in the report
- If `git diff` fails, fall back to asking the user for specific file paths
- If no code changes are found, inform the user and exit gracefully
- If no reviewers are selected (user deselected all), warn and require at least Virtual Mariusz
- If cleanup fails because teammates are still active, shut them down first and retry cleanup
